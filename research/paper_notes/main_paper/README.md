## In pursuit of a private DHT

Services based on P2P and decentralized networks are gaining traction
(e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, IPFS, Dat). People are calling this new wave of 
distributed and decentralized systems the Web 3.0. Many of these services and 
networks rely heavily on distributed hash tables (e.g. IPFS, bittorrent) or use 
it as an important building block (e.g. Ethereum). It is expected that DHTs will 
be an important building block for many networks and services in the web 3.0. 
However, DHTs are known for leaking data about its user's behaviors. Information
such as who is participating in the network; who is storing what; who is 
requesting what are easily collected with few computational resources.
The information leaked by DHTs can be used to target and censor
individuals, communities and services. Private, anonymous and metadata resistant
systems are important for ensuring that users privacy is protected against 
attackers. Thus - and given the importance DHTs will have in future services and 
networks - it is important to research and develop protocols and primitives
that keep DHT users anonymous.

### Summary of research goals

My current and future research questions are:

- How do currently deployed decentralized networks expose its users to privacy
  threats from internal and adversary adversaries.
- How to design and implement scalable, secure and anonymous decentralized 
	low-latency peer-to-peer (P2P) networks?
- How can decentralized P2P networks be used to build metadata resistant systems?
- How to design and implement incentive mechanisms for persuading honest peers
  in decentralized P2P networks for collaborating in ways that preserve peer 
	privacy.

### Motivation

My current and future research aims at improving and building primitives,
mechanisms and protocols for building private and metadata resistant

The new computation paradigm is decentralized networks and computation [ref], where P2P
protocols, linked data, incentive mechanisms and cryptography verification
primitives promise to give rise to ecosystems and services [ref]. In
decentralized networks, data and computation is distributed to untrusted peers. 

One problem with the current approach to computation is its data and computation
ownership model which incentives ... Data of the many in the hands
of the few along with an internet backbone which was not built to protect user's
data, opens up  censorship, mass and targeted surveillance and social coercion
[ref]. These problems are important to fix if we aim at building a free and fair
society.

Mass adoption of decentralized networks are potentially good news for those who 
concerned with user online privacy. Current centralized systems allow service 
providers to gather user data for analytical and commercial purposes - with all 
privacy problems inherent to that model [ref]. On the other hand, decentralized 
networks, on the other hand, the underlying network allows users
to control who have access to its personal data and restrict the access to
metadata [ref]. 

However, decentralized networks have an interesting paradox: although they are
the only way to achieve user privacy, naive implementation pose even more 
privacy threats than conventional centralized systems. 

This is due to the fact that decentralized networks rely on untrusted peers
routing messages and data which can be passively monitored by internal and
external adversaries.

My current and future research aims at improving and building primitives,
mechanisms and protocols for building private and metadata resistant 
decentralized networks.
